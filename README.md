IIIF Presentation API Application

## Name

This application is so-named because the phrase "Presentation API 
Application" could be abbreviated "PAPIA", which could be pronounced the 
same as "papaya", and because it is paired with the [Cantaloupe] IIIF 
image server in the UMD Libraries' IIIF services stack.
